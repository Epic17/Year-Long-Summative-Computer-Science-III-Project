# Year Long Summative Computer Science III Project
This year-long project challenges students to design, develop, and deploy a substantial Python application that addresses a real-world problem or fulfills a creative vision. Students will work independently through a series of structured phases, delivering incremental progress every 2-3 weeks and maintaining a detailed process journal. The project's open-ended nature allows students to choose a topic they are genuinely passionate about, fostering deeper engagement and learning.

# Project Goals:
* Apply advanced Python concepts: Utilize data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and potentially external libraries/APIs.
* Develop problem-solving skills: Analyze complex problems, break them into manageable components, and devise algorithmic solutions.
* Practice software development lifecycle: Experience planning, design, implementation, testing, and deployment.
* Cultivate independent learning: Research new technologies and solve unforeseen challenges.
* Foster creativity and interest: Choose a project that aligns with personal passions.
* Document the development process: Maintain a thorough process journal.
